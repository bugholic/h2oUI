            The world is heavily reliant on minerals like sodium, magnesium,
            calcium, bromine, lithium, and potassium. Many of these
            industries, such as magnesium and bromine, are struggling to keep
            up with current demand. These minerals can be found in large
            amounts in different brine (sea water, geothermal brine, oil&gas
            co-produce).

            Many places in the world don't have access to enough naturally
            potable water and require desalinated water. In the MENA region,
            for example, water consumption is higher than average, but access
            to potable running water is scarce in many countries. In the U.S.,
            many regions are already experiencing water shortage,

              Circular H2O's Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) and Mineral Extraction
